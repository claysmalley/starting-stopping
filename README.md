# Starting Stopping
This is a printable practice sheet for horn players being introduced to hand stopping technique.
On one page,
it includes an explanation of the history and mechanics of hand stopping,
a fingering reference,
and two exercises.
It assumes basic knowledge of the harmonic series,
horn hand placement,
and double horn fingerings.
